### importAnnotations
# *scene*: the scene from which annotations are taken. the implementation might just use
# drawing as json, but could also extract information from the scene itself. so pass the whole
# payload (just the same as for activateSnapshot)
# *source*: a string which indicates the source of the annotations. ideally this is a friendly name
# of the source or just the node id.
