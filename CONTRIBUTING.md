### General

Our approach is pretty much standard, but optimized for simple yet reviews by the community.

The path from discovering a bug or implementing a feature can be summarized as follows:
 * Create an issue for the feature/bug
 * Discuss the feature with the community. High-frequency discussion should happen in our discord channel
 * Implement the feature in a feature branch `features/thename`
 * Create a PR, ask for contributors to review the PR and merges the PR when done
 * For creating a new release, change the PRODUCT_RELEASE_NOTES.md accordingly. For details please look at https://github.com/pro3d-space/PRo3D/blob/main/docs/Build-Deploy-System.md
 * The CI will trigger a build and create a tag accordingly
