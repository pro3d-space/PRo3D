Starting from develop please create a feature branch so that we can follow our branching model (see below).

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Branches and Deployment

We use the git-branch model as described here: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

In short, we use feature branches, PRs to merge back to develop and create release branches starting there.
Also note that due to our automatic deployment systems our deployment heavily builds on tags which are automatically
created via changes in RELEASE_NOTES.md
