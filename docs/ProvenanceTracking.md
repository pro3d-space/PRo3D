# Provenance tracking in PRo3D

PRo3D has several features for manual, semi-automatic and automatic provenace tracking which have been developed in the *PROVEX* project.
The features need to be enabled by command-line-arguments as such:
```--disableCors --port 4321 --remoteApi --enableProvenance```

DisableCors is required when running PRo3D UI from the PROVEX web app. For communication with the webapp the `remoteApi` needs to be enabled.
To enable provenace features from within PRo3D `--enable-Provenance``is needed.

More about this stream of features was presented at ASTRA2023.
